.SH DESIGN This section describes some ramblings about the design.

SourceEngines register which source-types they support.
Each source-type can have a default source-engine. This can be set 
in a config-file. A Source-Engine processes the source and calls the
\'_new_entry\' callback function. For each entry it processes.
It is also possible to call \'_new_entries\' on a number of entries at
once, this could possibly speed up the parsing.
The source-engine can save the state of a source if that is relevant.
This could be usefull when parsing log-files.
